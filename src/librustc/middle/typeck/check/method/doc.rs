# Method lookup

Method lookup can be rather complex due to the interaction of a number
of factors, such as self types, autoderef, trait lookup, etc. The
algorithm is divided into two parts: candidate collection and
candidate selection.

## Candidate collection

A `Candidate` is a method item that might plausibly be the method
being invoked.  Candidates are grouped into two kinds, inherent and
extension.  Inherent candidates are those that are derived from the
type of the receiver itself.  So, if you have a receiver of some
nominal type `Foo` (e.g., a struct), any methods defined within an
impl like `impl Foo` are inherent methods.  Nothing needs to be
imported to use an inherent method, they are associated with the type
itself (note that inherent impls can only be defined in the same
module as the type itself).

Inherent candidates are not always derived from impls.  If you have a
trait instance, such as a value of type `@ToStr`, then the trait
methods (`to_str()`, in this case) are inherently associated with it.
Another case is type parameters, in which case the methods of their
bounds are inherent.

Extension candidates are derived from imported traits.  If I have the
trait `ToStr` imported, and I call `to_str()` on a value of type `T`,
then we will go off to find out whether there is an impl of `ToStr`
for `T`.  These kinds of method calls are called "extension methods".
They can be defined in any module, not only the one that defined `T`.
Furthermore, you must import the trait to call such a method.

For better or worse, we currently give weight to inherent methods over
extension methods during candidate selection (below).

## Candidate selection

Once we know the set of candidates, we can go off and try to select
which one is actually being called.  We do this by taking the type of
the receiver, let's call it R, and checking whether it matches against
the expected receiver type for each of the collected candidates.  We
first check for inherent candidates and see whether we get exactly one
match (zero means keep searching, more than one is an error).  If so,
we return that as the candidate.  Otherwise we search the extension
candidates in the same way.

If find no matching candidate at all, we proceed to auto-deref the
receiver type and search again.  We keep doing that until we cannot
auto-deref any longer.  At each step, we also check for candidates
based on "autoptr", which if the current type is `T`, checks for `&mut
T`, `&const T`, and `&T` receivers.  Finally, at the very end, we will
also try autoslice, which converts `~[]` to `&[]` (there is no point
at trying autoslice earlier, because no autoderefable type is also
sliceable).

## Why two phases?

You might wonder why we first collect the candidates and then select.
Both the inherent candidate collection and the candidate selection
proceed by progressively deref'ing the receiver type, after all.  The
answer is that two phases are needed to elegantly deal with explicit
self.  After all, if there is an impl for the type `Foo`, it can
define a method with the type `@self`, which means that it expects a
receiver of type `@Foo`.  If we have a receiver of type `@Foo`, but we
waited to search for that impl until we have deref'd the `@` away and
obtained the type `Foo`, we would never match this method.
